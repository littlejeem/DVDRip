# CDRip
#
# An experiment into seeing if i can work on / combine other peoples code to autmatically rip a CD to .m4a ALAC, FLAC and autotag including artwork
#
# Now syncs music to inuse directories
#
# Uses beets audio manager to tag files including artwork
#
# Scripts tidied up
#
# Comments added for guidance
#
# Installer script created 'InstallCDRip', will install necessary dependancies
#
# Uploaded .abcde.conf & config.yaml files for use with this script
# 
# Plan to see if i can make some kind of tarball / 'one command installer' for myself, might be usefull for others
#
# Need to review CDRip as I think there are unnecessary repetitions / redundant codes lines
